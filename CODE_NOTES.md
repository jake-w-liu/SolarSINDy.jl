# V2.2 Research Development Ledger

## Development Ledger

| Item | Record |
|---|---|
| Objective | Test whether a product layer anchored to the frozen V2.1 SINDy-20/11 model can beat every same-row local comparator at 1, 2, 3, and 6 h without weakening storm safety. |
| Contract | Preserve the V2.1 coefficients; use issue-time information only; retain at least 60% combined served/frozen SINDy weight; distinguish anchor-relative model step from issue-relative product horizon; fail closed on missing rows, unsupported leads, lag mismatch, or corrupt artifacts. |
| Evidence | The source replay, primary stack, residual table, cross-fit table, feature schema, and learner version are hash-pinned. The development partitions end before 2023. |
| Independent oracles | Hand-computed constrained blends, synthetic known-weight recovery, exact live-kernel/replay identity, post-issue mutation invariance, whole-anchor embargoes, exact portable-EvoTrees inference, and artifact corruption tests. |
| Test plan | Focused tests cover the primary stack, sparse residual, portable boosted residual, served replay, and expanding-window cross-fit. The full package suite and deterministic package experiment are required before handoff. |
| Baseline verification | Every development row carries served and frozen V2.1, raw SINDy, persistence, Burton, Burton full, and O'Brien--McPherron predictions under a common finite-row mask. |
| Data regeneration trigger | Changes to split, feature, primary-stack, or learner code require rebuilding the affected replay and audit tables and rechecking their pinned hashes before interpreting scores. |
| Harness | `julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'`; `julia --project=. examples/experiments.jl`; the repository development-harness audit against this worktree. |
| Risk | The main risks are post-issue leakage, repeated selection on one validation period, lag-zero/lag-one horizon confusion, hidden SINDy removal, artifact drift, and optimistic promotion from a small effect. |

## Implementation correctness gate

The implementation is isolated on `research/v2.2-accuracy`. The production
V2.1 checkout and running services are outside this worktree and are not
modified by the research code.

The primary constrained stack, sparse residual, portable boosted residual,
causal served replay, and expanding-window cross-fit have independent focused
tests. The nonlinear development runner reads only the pinned pre-2023 replay,
uses fixed 168 h issue clusters, and records zero exposed-benchmark rows read.

## Scientific outcome

The primary stack improved on the best same-row local comparator by only
0.0216--0.0604 nT on the four primary leads. The sparse residual passed its
regime guards only at 1 h. The frozen nonlinear family had no safe cross-fitted
setting at 2, 3, or 4 h; its final diagnostic gains remained below 0.25 nT at
every supported lead and the 6 and 7 h settings worsened safety cells.

The result is `NO_GO`. These modules are retained as reproducible research
infrastructure, not as a deployable V2.2 artifact.
